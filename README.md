# storybook-addon-toggle-padding
Adds a toolbar button to toggle body padding in the story on and off.

## Demo
![Demo](https://github.com/art0rz/storybook-addon-toggle-padding/raw/main/demo.gif)


## Why?
I often use a browser extension to overlay designs over the component. Without body padding it makes it easier to make sure my component lines up correctly.
